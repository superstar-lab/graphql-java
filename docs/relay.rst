Relay Support
==============


Very basic support for `Relay <https://github.com/facebook/relay`_ is included.

**Note**: Relay refers here to "Relay Classic", there is no support for "Relay Modern".

Please look at https://github.com/graphql-java/todomvc-relay-java for a full example project,

Relay send queries to the GraphQL server as JSON containing a ``query`` field and a ``variables`` field. The ``query`` field is a JSON string,
and the ``variables`` field is a map of variable definitions. A relay-compatible server will need to parse this JSON and pass the ``query``
string to this library as the query and the ``variables`` map as the third argument to ``execute`` as shown below.

.. code-block:: java

    @RequestMapping(value = "/graphql", method = RequestMethod.POST, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    @ResponseBody
    public Object executeOperation(@RequestBody Map body) {
        String query = (String) body.get("query");
        Map<String, Object> variables = (Map<String, Object>) body.get("variables");
        if (variables == null) {
            variables = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        }
        ExecutionResult executionResult = graphql.execute(query, (Object) null, variables);
        Map<String, Object> result = new LinkedHashMap<>();
        if (executionResult.getErrors().size() > 0) {
            result.put("errors", executionResult.getErrors());
            log.error("Errors: {}", executionResult.getErrors());
        }
        result.put("data", executionResult.getData());
        return result;
    }


Apollo Support
---------------

There is no special support for `Apollo <https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client>`_ included: Apollo works with any schema.

The Controller example shown above works with Apollo too.
