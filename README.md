# graphql-java

This is a GraphQL Java implementation based on the [specification](https://github.com/facebook/graphql) 
and the JavaScript [reference implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js). 
   
It's an early version, but the query parser should be near 100%.

The execution part is WIP, and validation, error handling and more is still missing.  

For a very simple (yet complete) use-case how to use graphql-java: [GraphQL Test](src/test/groovy/graphql/GraphQLTest.groovy)

### Details

graphql-java is based on the same idea as the reference implementation: It assumes nothing about the persistence technology. 
Instead hooks/callbacks are provided to fetch the data.

The implementation is in Java 7, but the tests are in Groovy and [Spock](https://github.com/spockframework/spock).

The query parsing is done with [ANTLR](www.antlr.org). The grammar is [here](src/main/grammar/Graphql.g4).
